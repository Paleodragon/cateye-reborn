              <p>This business card was designed for a freelance musician and horn instructor whose primary instrument is a silver french horn. The emphasis was on giving her a clean design that calls attention to her orchestral background and professionality.</p>

              <p>In this inspirational poster, the monochrome background with striking orange font is meant to emphasize the passionate subject, and long shadow is used to create depth, drawing the eyes to the statement and adding an element of mystery.</p>
